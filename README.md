Overview -
Over time I have put substantial effort into learning and developing the foundational skills I have acquired. This guided project by Mo Chen was the next step in that process. Applying concepts to a real-life dataset helped me to gain a deeper understanding and passion in the field of analytics. I plan to pursue all avenues that will advance my knowledge and this project has accomplished that goal. 

Lessons learned -
I was able to utilize IF functions as well as XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, and INDEX/MATCH to gather and clean data. I inserted a timeline and connected slicers to the pivot charts and pivot tables created to display visuals that would help convey valuable takeaways.
